# Catorant
A webshop packed with features ~~(not at the time of writing this)~~ built specifically with scalability in mind. It uses a microservice architecture and gRPC. The individual microservices are built using different programming languages just to demonstrate the possiblities of gRPC (this might have a slight impact on performance).
