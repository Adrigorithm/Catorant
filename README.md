# Catorant
A webshop packed with features ~~(not at the time of writing this)~~ built specifically with scalability in mind. It uses a microservice architecture and gRPC. The individual microservices are built using different programming languages just to demonstrate the possiblities of gRPC (this might have a slight impact on performance).

## Details
Each microservice will have its own README.md file. Check these files to get a deeper understanding of the underlying infrastructure of the whole app.
