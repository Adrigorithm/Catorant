# Frontend service

This is the frontend microservice. It is 2024 so we do not touch JavaScript anymore :^). It is written in Go(lang) because it is fast and fun to work with. As it is from google it also has excellent gGPC support. 

## No JS, Really?

Perhaps I've witheld some crucial information. WASM does not alloy DOM tree manipulation yet therefore there will be some JS (hopefully not though). Please do not run JavaScript on the server.
